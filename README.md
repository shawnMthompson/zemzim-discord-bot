# zemzim-discord-bot

Utilized JavaScript and Node.js to architect and implement a bot, capitalizing on its asynchronous and event-driven capabilities for efficient Discord API integration. Zemzim is a bot with tournament functionality that can help to generate a randomized order of members for games, flip coins for 50/50s, generate random pairs for teams, and more!

# Installation Information

In order to clone the bot, you must first install Node.js and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies in order to allow the bot to function. You will also need to create a `.env` file at the root of the project folder and place the appropriate `TOKEN=x` and `CLIENT_ID=x` for your bot.

In order to fully set up the bot and get it running on Discord, refer to the Discord Developer Platform linked [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

# Tasks

- Rework .gitignore (e.g. excluding the ds_store file.) (sample one of the basic node ones)
- Refactor unoptimized and redundant code, as well as comments for clarity.
- Migrate `config.js` to a `.env` file for security and easier manipulation; ensure to add the dependency first of course. Change the 'Important Information' section appropriately
