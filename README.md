# zemzim-discord-bot
Utilized JavaScript and Node.js to architect and implement a bot, capitalizing on its asynchronous and event-driven capabilities for efficient Discord API integration. Zemzim is a bot with tournament functionality that can help to generate a randomized order of members for games, flip coins for 50/50s, generate random pairs for teams, and more!

# Important Information
In order to clone the bot, you must create a config.js file in the root folder, containing the TOKEN and the CLIENT_ID for your bot (replacing x with the respective information found in the Discord Developer Platform for your specific bot):

export const config = {
    TOKEN: 'x',
    CLIENT_ID: 'x'
  };
